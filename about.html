    <h1>About InvestoLab</h1>
    <p>Why this website is needed and how it helps investors make better decisions.</p>

      <h2>Why InvestoLab Exists</h2>
      <p>Most investors do not fail because they cannot find information. They fail because there is <strong>too much conflicting information</strong> and not enough clear decision support.</p>
      <p>Prices, headlines, social sentiment, and macro events move fast. Manually combining all of that into a consistent decision is hard, especially under stress.</p>
      <p>InvestoLab exists to close that gap: it turns raw market noise into structured, explainable actions you can use.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>The Real Problems It Solves</h2>

      <h3>1. Information Overload</h3>
      <p>Checking dozens of sources every day is not realistic for most people. InvestoLab summarizes market context into clear scores, risk signals, and recommendations.</p>

      <h3>2. One-Size-Fits-All Advice</h3>
      <p>Two investors can look at the same asset and need different actions. InvestoLab personalizes outputs by investor type and behavior profile instead of giving generic advice.</p>

      <h3>3. Emotional Decision Errors</h3>
      <p>Many losses come from panic selling, overtrading, and chasing momentum. InvestoLab uses simulation and profile tools to help users understand and reduce these behavior risks.</p>

      <h3>4. Black-Box Recommendations</h3>
      <p>A signal is not useful if you cannot trust it. InvestoLab emphasizes explainable outputs so users can see why a recommendation was produced.</p>
